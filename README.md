# Email Inbox with Custom Phishing Warnings

This is the source code for the IEEE Security & Privacy paper: 

*Justin Petelka, Benjamin Berens, Carlo Sugatan, Melanie Volkamer, and Florian Schaub. "Restricting the Link: Effects of Focused Attention and Time Delay on Phishing Warning Effectiveness." Under Review; IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. 2025.*

This repo creates a website that displays emails, records user hovers and clicks, and displays custom anti-phishing warnings. We used this project to identify differences in how people click and hover in emails when confronted with different types of anti-phishing warning.

This source code requires `Python 3.10` and the Python library `Django 4.1` (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/).

## Features
This project displays selected emails inside of a realistic email inbox, records user mouse interactions with hyperlinks (e.g., clicks and hovers), and displays customized anti-phishing warnings.

## Installation
Please see our Installation document to deploy this project on your device.

## Customization
Please see our Customization document to change how and where anti-phishing warnings are displayed.

## Repo Maintenance
